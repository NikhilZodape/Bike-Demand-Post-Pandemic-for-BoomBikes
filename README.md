In this project, we address the critical challenge faced by BoomBikes, a US-based bike-sharing provider, in predicting the demand for shared bikes post-pandemic to boost revenue. Through a meticulous analysis of various factors influencing bike demand, including meteorological data and customer behavior, we developed a multiple linear regression model. This model not only identifies significant variables affecting bike demand but also provides insights into demand dynamics in the American market.

By leveraging data analytics, BoomBikes aims to tailor its business strategy to meet customer expectations, optimize service levels, and gain a competitive edge in the market. The model's accuracy enables BoomBikes to forecast demand accurately, thereby enhancing resource allocation and ultimately driving profitability and growth.

With this predictive model, BoomBikes can navigate the challenges posed by the pandemic and emerge stronger in the post-pandemic era, ensuring continued success in the competitive bike-sharing market.
